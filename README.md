### 🔍 Data Quality & Pattern Summary

---

#### 📌 **Missing Values & Inconsistencies**
- **Income**: Missing in several rows (e.g., CUST0041, CUST0060, CUST0067, CUST0094, etc.)
- **Loan_Balance**: Missing in some records (e.g., CUST0009, CUST0024, CUST0026, etc.)
- **Credit_Score**: No missing values observed.
- **Employment_Status**: Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., “EMP”, “employed”, “Employed”, “Self-employed”, etc.)
- **Credit_Card_Type**: Values like “Student”, “Standard”, “Platinum”, “Gold”, “Business” — all valid but categorical.

---

#### 📊 **Key Anomalies & Outliers**
- **Credit_Utilization**: Some values exceed 1.0 (e.g., CUST0090: 1.026, CUST0266: 1.025) — may indicate data error or extreme debt.
- **Debt_to_Income_Ratio**: Several values are exactly 0.1 (e.g., CUST0035, CUST0115, CUST0121, etc.) — may be placeholder or imputed value.
- **Age**: Some very young customers (e.g., 18–20) with high income or high credit scores — may warrant verification.

---

#### ⚠️ **Early Indicators of Delinquency Risk**
- **Missed_Payments**: High correlation with `Delinquent_Account = 1`.
- **Credit_Utilization**: Higher values often associated with missed payments.
- **Payment History (Month_1 to Month_6)**: Patterns like repeated “Late” or “Missed” payments are strong predictors.
- **Employment_Status**: “Unemployed” or “Self-employed” show higher delinquency rates.
- **Credit_Score**: Lower scores correlate with higher risk.

---

### 🎯 **Top 3 Predictive Variables for Delinquency**

1. **Missed_Payments**  
   - Directly reflects past behavior; strong correlation with delinquency.

2. **Credit_Utilization**  
   - High utilization often precedes financial stress and missed payments.

3. **Payment History (e.g., Month_6 status)**  
   - Recent behavior is a strong indicator of future delinquency.

---

### 📄 **Summary Paragraph**

The dataset contains several missing values in `Income` and `Loan_Balance`, which may require imputation or exclusion. Inconsistencies in `Employment_Status` capitalization should be standardized. Anomalies like `Credit_Utilization` values above 1.0 and repeated `Debt_to_Income_Ratio` values of 0.1 suggest possible data entry errors or imputation. Key predictors like `Missed_Payments`, `Credit_Utilization`, and recent payment history show strong potential for forecasting delinquency. Overall, the data is moderately clean but requires preprocessing for reliable modeling.

### 📊 Missing Data Imputation Strategy

| Missing Field         | Handling Method                          | Justification |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Income                | Impute using median income by Employment_Status and Age group | Reduces bias and maintains distribution within demographic segments. |
| Loan_Balance          | Impute with 0 (if logical) or median by Credit_Card_Type | Assumes missing values may indicate no loan or uses typical values per card type. |
| Credit_Utilization    | Impute with median by Credit_Score bucket | Maintains relationship between credit health and utilization behavior. |

---

### 💡 Best-Practice Methods for Handling Missing Credit Utilization Data

- Use **multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE)** if missingness is MAR (Missing At Random).
- Alternatively, **impute with median/mean within segments** (e.g., by Credit_Score, Income bracket) to preserve correlations.
- Consider adding a **missingness indicator flag** to capture potential informative missingness.

---

### 📈 Synthetic Income Generation Using Normal Distribution

Assuming income is roughly normally distributed within employment categories:

```python
# Example for employed individuals:
mean_income_employed = 100000
std_income_employed = 30000

synthetic_income = np.random.normal(mean_income_employed, std_income_employed, size=number_of_missing)
```

Apply similar logic per `Employment_Status` group to maintain realism.

Step 3: Detect patterns and risk factors
With a cleaned dataset, your next goal is to uncover patterns and key risk factors that influence delinquency.

What to do:

Analyze relationships between variables and delinquency outcomes (e.g., is high credit utilization associated with missed payments?).
Use GenAI tools to help surface insights and prioritize key variables.
Highlight any unexpected findings that may require further investigation by the analytics team.
Document key risk indicators and any insights that could impact delinquency prediction. Include patterns that seem obvious as well as any surprising trends that might need deeper investigation.
Action: List high-risk indicators, each with a one-sentence explanation of why it’s important, as well as any insights that could impact delinquency prediction.

### 🚨 High-Risk Indicators for Delinquency

| Risk Indicator              | Why It Matters |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| High Credit Utilization     | Customers using a high percentage of their available credit are more likely to miss payments due to financial strain. |
| Multiple Missed Payments    | A history of missed payments is the strongest direct predictor of future delinquency. |
| Low Credit Score            | Lower credit scores indicate past financial issues and higher risk of default. |
| Unemployed or Self-Employed | Income instability increases the likelihood of payment difficulties. |
| Short Account Tenure        | Newer customers lack a established payment history, making risk harder to assess. |
| High Debt-to-Income Ratio   | Customers with high debt relative to income have less disposable income to make payments. |

### 🔍 Key Insights & Unexpected Findings

- **Younger customers with high income** sometimes show high delinquency—may indicate irresponsible spending despite high earnings.
- **Some retirees with low income but high credit scores** remain low-risk—suggesting credit history matters more than current income for this group.
- **“Business” credit card holders** show mixed risk—may depend on business revenue stability not captured in personal income.
- **Customers with very low (0.05) credit utilization** still sometimes delinquent—suggesting possible dormant accounts or unusual spending patterns.

---

### ⚠️ Note for Further Investigation

- **Credit Utilization > 1.0**: May indicate data errors or extreme debt—requires validation.
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio = 0.1**: Repeating value suggests possible placeholder entries—needs review.
- **Geographic patterns**: Certain cities (e.g., Phoenix, Chicago) show higher delinquency rates—may reflect economic factors.
